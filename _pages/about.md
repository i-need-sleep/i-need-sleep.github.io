Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a second-year master's student in natural language processing at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) supervised by Professors [Timothy Baldwin](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/timothy-baldwin/) and [Gus Xia](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/dr-gus-xia/). I completed my undergraduate studies at [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) where I double majored in Computer Science and Data Science under the supervision of Professors Gus Xia and [Yik-Cheung Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam).

My research interest is in natural language processing and music artificial intelligence.

During my off-time, I am a half-baked guitarist. I design and run AI-assisted D&D campaigns, and I work on cringy jokes (I learn from [the best](http://musicxlab.com/#/people)).
